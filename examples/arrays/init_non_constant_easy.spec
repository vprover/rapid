// Variation of init_non_constant, where multiplication is removed.
// Properties:
// 1) after the execution, a[pos] has the value pos+v for each position pos in the array
// 2) if v is greater than 0, a[pos] is greater than pos
// 3) if v is strictly greater than 0, a[pos] is strictly greater than pos (variation of property 2)
// 4) if v is some positive constant, a[pos] is strictly greater than pos (variation of property 2)
